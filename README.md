## Introduction

Welcome to the Real Estate Manager Simulation Game, a captivating simulation where you take on the role of a single real estate manager in charge of an office building in an undisclosed city. 

## Overview

As the manager, your objective is to build and upgrade your office building strategically to maximize your earnings. Here's a quick rundown of the key features:

### Building Upgrades

- **Add Floors:** Expand your building by adding more floors to increase your potential earnings.

- **Helipad Construction:** Build a helipad on the roof to significantly boost your monthly rental income.

### Rent Management

- **Rent Slider:** Set the rent amount per floor to determine the total income. Be cautious as setting high rents may lead to unhappy inhabitants.
